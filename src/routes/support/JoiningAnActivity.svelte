        <strong>Click the join button.</strong> Yes, it's just THAT simple. The join
        button enables itself 5 minutes before the scheduled start time and will
        remain active for the duration of the activity. THAT works in any browser
        and you just need to enable your webcam and microphone. We do require everyone
        to login before joining any Activity. You're mic will always be muted by
        default and your camera will be enabled. Activites are currently limited
        to 100 concurrent attedees.

      <h2>Activity Etiquette</h2>
      <p>
        We want everyone to be epic and help one another. We've compiled a list
        of guiding principals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Always be nice.</li>
        <li>Raise hand to speak üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.</li>
        <li>Mute yourself when not speaking.</li>
        <li>Speak clearly so others can hear you.</li>
        <li>Create space so others can speak.</li>
        <li>
          Be careful not to speak over or interrupt others while they are
          speaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn your camera on so everyone else knows you're not a cyborg üìπ..
        </li>
        <li>
          Use care with humor. If you feel the need to use humor during
          meetings, make sure that it's appropriate for your audience. THAT
          serves a global audience and sometimes while many speak English not
          everything translates well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't eat while speaking. Eating while listening, muted is fine.
        </li>
        <li>Keep your cool üòé.</li>
        <li>Dress appropriately üëï.</li>
      </ul>
