      <p>
        Life moves fast and you have enough to sift through already. Our goal is
        to make it very easy to stay up to date with everything THAT, while not
        becoming refrigerator noise. To that end, we currently have three
        different ways you can stay up to date.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Activity Board & My Favorites.</li>
        <li>Subsribe to our shared calendar.</li>
        <li>#that_board in Slack.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Activity Board and My Favorites</h2>
      <p>
        <Link href="/activities">The Activity Board</Link>
        as we call it, is your main place to find out what's up next. It will
        always show all Activities from today looking forward. You can also find
        <strong class="italic">all</strong>
        Activities
        <Link href="/events/thatUs">here</Link>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <Link href="/my/favorites">My Favorites</Link>
        is just like the Activity Board but filtered to the Activities you've
        already favorited. This is great during times of high usage or for
        historical reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>Calendar Feed</h2>
      <p>
        Most people live by their calendars. We've created a shared Google
        calender that you can subscribe to. This calendar is updated as
        Activities are created and every entry reflects all of the same
        information you would find on the Activity details page. The link below
        will copy to your clipboard for you to use in your favorite calendar
        program.
      </p>

      <div class="text-center">
        <button
          id="calendarUrl"
          data-clipboard-text="https://bit.ly/2YRdVxy"
          class="px-4 py-2 rounded-md shadow text-base leading-6 font-medium border-2

        >
          {copiedText}
        </button>
      </div>

      <h2>#that_board in THAT Slack</h2>
      <p>
        Of course we wouldn't forget our very active Slack Channel. There is a
        dedicated channel in our Slack (#that_board) which not only receives
        realtime updates when the Activities are created but it will also send a
        daily and hourly digest when an Activity is scheduled. If you're not in
        our Slack, join us today!
      </p>

      <div class="text-center my-12">
        <StandardLink open="{true}" href="https://thatslack.thatconference.com">
          Join us in THAT Slack
        </StandardLink>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over time we will continue to extend THAT in new and interesting ways.
        It's our goal to connect you to the relavent topics, and help you grow
        your network accordingly based on your interests.
