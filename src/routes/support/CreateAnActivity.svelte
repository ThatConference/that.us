        It's THAT time! You're now ready to create your first Activity. We
        couldn't be more excited and want to make sure you get started off
        right.
      </p>

          Create an Activity

      </div>

      <p>
        To create an Activity you first need to
        <Link href="/login">login</Link>
        if you're not already. If you still need an account simply
        <Link href="/login?signup=true">create one here</Link>, and then update
        your
        <Link href="/my/settings/profile">profile accordingly</Link>. Once
        completed you can then create a
        <Link href="/activity/create">New Activity</Link>. It's here where you
        will detail out the conversation, inviting others to join in. The
        submission process isn't complex but it's important as you want to make
        sure the right people join in your Activity.

          <strong class="italic">Description: </strong>Here you explain a bit
          more about the potential conversation you're wishing to have. If
          you're seeking help from others explain what help you think you need
          so others who might have the answer know if they're able to help.

          are joining and you can pick anytime throughout the day as to best
          overlap with different timezones.

        If you'd like to browse through some of our past Activities you will

        Activity you'll receive an email confirmation which will also include a
        calendar attachment.

      <h2>Need to Update your Activity?</h2>
      <p>
        No problem we all make mistakes or maybe you just want to tweak things a
        bit further. No problem. You can find all of your submitted Activities
        <Link href="/my/submissions">here</Link>, we call it
        <span class="italic">My Submissions</span> and you will always find it under
        your profile picture. Just pick the correct Activity and then select edit.
