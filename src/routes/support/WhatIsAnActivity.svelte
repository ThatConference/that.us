        <strong>Activities</strong> are topic-based scheduled gatherings that anyone
        can create for any multitude of reasons in which anyone can join. An activity
        is simple, a video call in the browser with no tools required. Every Activity
        has a chat window, the ability to share your desktop, and enables your webcam
        and microphone. You choose the format that best suits the topic and the people
        in the conversation.
      </p>

      <h2>What makes a good Activity?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          An activity's success shouldn't be graded on the number of people in
          attendance but rather the conversation which was had and the knowledge
          that was shared.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Yes, anything can be an Activity. Activities are about the people
        involved and the conversation that will be had. They're meant to be
        dynamic and highly interactive. The topic and the user's problems should
        determine the format to allow everyone to learn together. So what can
        you do, well anything but here are a few things that have happened to
        date:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Presentations</li>
        <li>User group meetings</li>
        <li>Virtual conferences</li>
        <li>Office Hours</li>
        <li>Code Reviews</li>
        <li>Design Reviews</li>
        <li>Interactive Workshops</li>
        <li>Q&A</li>
        <li>AMA</li>
        <li>Just Get Together and Chat</li>
      </ul>

      </div>

      <h2>How long can an Activity be?</h2>
      <p>
        The length of an Activity is up to you. An Activity may be a short 30
        minutes or last all day. We have seen quick 30-minute issue triage, to
        an entire weekend hackathon-type activity. It's entirely up to you and
        what you are trying to achieve. In the example above you will see our
        bi-weekly sprint review which typically lasts for an hour.
      </p>

      <h2>Who can create and who can join an Activity?</h2>
      <p>
        Anybody and Anybody! That's correct. Anyone with an active public THAT
        account is allowed to create an activity. As for joining, anyone with an
        active THAT account can join.
